+ Animation styles may be used with or without default CSS styles
+ Transition (in between actual hover-off and the delayed hover-off handler) style may be defined in the same manner as hover-off
+ Hover-on style may be defined in the same manner as hover-off
+ All styles may be alternatively defined as a handler function, taking as arguments, the jQuery wrapped element, your callback, and other options
